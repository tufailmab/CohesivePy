**Limitation & Requirement**

This script is narrowly scoped and will function correctly **only** for input files that include:

- The keyword `*Cohesive Behavior`
- Followed directly by a stiffness definition line containing `knn, kss, ktt`

Absence of these elements means the script will skip modification (no error is raised, but no new files are generated either).
